3. To smoothen the curve you just drew, press 'S' key. <br />
4. To save the drawing to an image , press 'X'. <br />
5. To clear out the screen , press 'C'. <br />
6. Make sure , your full hand is in the coverage area of the webcam when you draw the line and only one hand is within the frame.<br />
